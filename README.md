# BATCH DURATION: December 30th, 2024 to January 30th, 2025

# MENTOR NAME: Vaishali

# DESCRIPTION:
This is a temperature monitoring system built using an Arduino Uno microcontroller, an LM35 temperature sensor, a 16x2 LCD display, and additional electronic components. The system is designed to measure the ambient temperature and display the real-time value on the LCD.

# Key Components:
1. Arduino uno R3
2. LM35 Temprature sensor
3. 16x2 LCD Display
4. Potentiometer
5. Resistors
# Working Principle:
1. The LM35 sensor measures the ambient temperature and generates an analog voltage proportional to the temperature.
2. This analog signal is fed to the Arduino's ADC, which converts it into a digital value. The Arduino's software processes this value to calculate the temperature in Celsius.
3. The calculated temperature is sent to the 16x2 LCD, where it is displayed in real time.
4. The user can adjust the LCD brightness using the potentiometer for optimal readability.
